# Django Timetable Generator 📅

This project is an automated timetable scheduling system built with **Django** and **Google OR-Tools**.  
It uses constraint satisfaction programming to generate valid weekly schedules for multiple sections, faculties, and classrooms based on predefined rules.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Constraint-Based Scheduling:** Automatically avoids conflicts for classrooms, faculties, and sections.  
- **Custom Rule Enforcement:**
  - Prevents sections from having classes for the same subject in consecutive periods.
  - Enforces faculty workload limits (e.g., a faculty member can teach a maximum of two distinct subjects).
- **Team Teaching Support:** Assign multiple faculty members to a single course (e.g., one for theory, one for tutorials).  
- **Web Interface:** Filterable timetable view by section.  
- **Django Admin Integration:** Manage subjects, sections, faculties, and classrooms easily.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Django  
- **Constraint Solver:** Google OR-Tools (CP-SAT Solver)  
- **Database:** SQLite (default, can be changed)
